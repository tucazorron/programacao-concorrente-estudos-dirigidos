# ReflexGame

This project was developed in IntelliJ idea. If you are gonna run this in the same IDE, and you get an error
you may do this: 
* Go to "Run" 
* Go to "Edit configurations" 
* In "VM options" add the following line: 
	* --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media --module-path "YOUR_PATH_TO_JAVAFX_LIB_FOLDER"

Thanks for testing this out!

This was a little game developed using Threads, hope it's useful for you!
