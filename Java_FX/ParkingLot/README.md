# ProyectoEstacionamiento

Project developed using semaphores to control the access to a parking lot.
It generates a dynamic number of cars and parking lots (# of parking lots = # of cars/2)
And it determines whether or not a car can leave (it has a random amount of seconds to stay in the parking lot) or access the parking lot (it has enough spaces)
